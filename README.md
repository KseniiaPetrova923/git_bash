# Working with Git and Bash
As part of the course, I worked with basic Bash commands: created, moved and deleted files and folders, edited content, performed searches, worked with processes and APIs. This experience helped me better understand the command line and file management in the terminal.

Below is the example of my work:
[bash1.txt](https://github.com/KseniiaPetrova923/git_bash/blob/main/bash1.txt)
[bash2.txt](https://github.com/KseniiaPetrova923/git_bash/blob/main/bash2.txt) 

## TASK 1.

| Заголовок 1 | Заголовок 2 |
|------------|------------|
| Строка 1.1 | Строка 1.2 |
| Строка 2.1 | Строка 2.2 |
pwd
mkdir test1
cd test1
touch 1.txt
touch 2.txt
touch 3.txt
ls
cd ..
mkdir test2
rmdir test2
rm test1/2.txt
mkdir test3
cd test3
touch 4.txt
touch 5.txt
cd .. 
rm -r test3
mkdir test4
mv test1/1.txt test4 
mv test1/3.txt test4
cd test4
echo "line" >> 1.txt
echo "line" >> 1.txt
echo "line" >> 1.txt
cat 1.txt
echo "line" >> 3.txt
echo "line" >> 3.txt
echo "line" >> 3.txt
cat 1.txt 3.txt
echo "lalala" > 1.txt
